To-do List Web App - JavaScript Project from The Odin Project

Building from scratch, a To-Do List web app using JavaScript.

This project will help me solidify my recent learning of organizing my JavaScript code using: object constructors or factory functions or classes, ES6 Modules, npm, Webpack and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

As my current daily to-do list I use for housework (washing and cleaning etc) is a simply notes app with a checkbox, this prompted me look at the current best to-do apps for personal use such as: Todoist, any.do and Microsoft to do.

However, I found these apps to be too complex for my needs and decided to create a simple to-do app for my daily housework and to store recipes with the following features:

1. A priority setting on each item to see what to do first.
2. For irregular reoccurring items, the ability to change to the next due date (such as washing dishes every 2-3 days) without removing and creating a new item.
3. A list with items that are not removed automatically, to see what was done (for recipes).

**This app can only save data on user's computer that it was created on** (using localStorage API)
